On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 8 April 2020 ~
I joined the repository of the group on GitHub
Tried to figure out the different methods included on Android Studio. Also searched about basics of AndroidStudio
like activities, UML etc.

### ~ 15 April 2020~
Watched videos about Android Studio on how to use it and learned about layouts (absolute, relative etc.) and 
searched on how to use the camera of the phone for our app. 


### ~ 22 April 2020
I did brainstorm about the ideas to draw our UML, and to build a class hierarchy for
our project. Adjusted the Help page, but we changed it afterwards.

### ~ 29 April 2020

I learned how to switch between activities by creating buttons and ActionListeners etc. Researched on how to 
store the photos that we took in the app and perhaps how to show them subsequently to create a stop motion movie
of ours. 

### ~ 6 May 2020
This week I drew the UML diagram of our code and made some thumbnails and logos through Photoshop. I also researched 
on how we can store the pictures taken by the camera of our app, but I couldn't implement it in our program.  

### ~ 13 May 2020
This week, Ata and I wrote the code for drawActivity class and integrated it to our program code, the class adds a
feature that allows the user to draw onto the photos taken. 

### ~ 20 May 2020 ~
I took the video of my part of the presentation.
