On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 8th April 2020 ~
I joined the repository of the group on GitHub
Tried to figure out the different methods included on Android Studio. Also searched about activity etc.

### ~ 15th April 2020~
Watched videos about Android Studio, on how to use it and learned about layouts and 
searched on how to use the camera of the phone for our app.


### ~ 22th April 2020
I did brainstorm about the ideas to draw our UML, and to build a class hierarchy.
