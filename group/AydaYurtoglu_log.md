On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 7th April 2020 ~
I created a project repository on GitHub and invited all the group members.
I also downloaded Android Studio.

### ~ 16th April 2020 ~
I watched some videos about Android Studio to get familiar with it during this week. 

### ~ 25th April 2020 ~
I did research on Bitmap class and come up with a UML diagram on my own.
I tried writing some code in Android Studio.

### ~ 27th April 2020 ~
I recreated the logs of our group as our instructor wanted.
I combined my, Ece's and Beste's UML diagrams into one diagram.

### ~ 30th April 2020 ~
I did more research on classes and library of Android Studio.
I tried writing the Photo class but failed.

### ~ 4th May 2020 ~
Can and I teamed up to create and design different activities.
We worked on it together for three hours.

### ~ 5th May 2020 ~
Can and I worked on the same activities today but we realised that we need
to know databases to construct our app. So we will have a meeting tomorrow to make our
design easier.

### ~ 6th May 2020 ~
I worked on the design of the activities and discovered a class called
ViewFlipper. I created an AutoImageSlider class. Although ViewFlipper 
is a layout and not a file that can be saved, I could make animations 
with it. Can and I did further research on we can save the animation 
as a file.

### ~ 7th May 2020 ~
I researched on how we can store the photos taken by the camera with
Beste and Ece. We couldn't fix the error together. We tried different
libraries we found on the internet.
