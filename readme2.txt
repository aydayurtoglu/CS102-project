Title: Momentum
Description: An animation app that makes creating stop motion animation easier!
Current status: Uncompleted

The app can create an animation project. It has a camera implemented in it and with
the camera, the user can capture images and store them in an internal storage file.
But we couldn't retrieve those images from the file and instead used default images
that are stored in R.drawable file. The app shows these images in an image gallery
and allows the user to draw on them. However, there is only one color for the brush
and the new image with drawings on it is not saved within the image gallery. Still,
the images in the gallery can be used to create an animation of them. The user can
adjust the speed of the animation and play it repeatedly by clicking on the project.
But the project can't be saved as a video, it can only be seen as an animation 
within the app.

The storage problem should be fixed and some minor adjustments to the DrawActivity
can be made. We should make animation as a video that can be saved. We should use
a database to allow the app to create more than one project at a time. The creating
and adding stickers to the images and adding sound files to the project should be 
added.

What we have worked on:

Ayda: I worked on creating multiple projects at the same time at first, it didn't
work. I created my own UML diagram and combined the others, but it changed over time.
Can and I teamed up to design the overall view of the app. We wrote AutoImageSlider
class and did research on how we can create animation with images together. I helped
to the construction of the camera a bit. I wrote ImageAdapter class, Fullscreen
Activity and ImageGallery Activity. We adjusted the ImageAdapter class with the other
group members. I did research on the storage of images a lot. I finalized some of 
the reports, the code and the UML diagram.
